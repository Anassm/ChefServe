## Recommendations for Improvement (Optional)

While the project is sufficient for passing, these enhancements could improve the grade:

1. Add comprehensive logging (as covered in week 13)
2. Add unit and integration tests
3. Move hardcoded URLs to configuration
4. Add more detailed API documentation/comments
5. Implement additional error handling UI
6. Add input validation with dedicated library
7. Enable HTTPS in production configuration

These are suggestions for excellence, not requirements for passing.
